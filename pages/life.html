							<p class="paragraph">
								Another thing that is absolutely essential to our Christian life
								is prayer. Prayer is more than asking God for stuff, it is
								completely casting all our cares upon God and trusting him and
								also thanking him and worshipping him.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="verse">
								"Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
								supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
								unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,
								shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
								Philippians 4:6-7
							</blockquote>
							<p class="paragraph">
								If you don't know how to pray, Jesus taught a simple way of
								praying.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="verse">
								"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
								heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
								in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
								And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us
								not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the
								kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen." Matthew
								6:9-13
							</blockquote>
							<p class="paragraph">
								Also, there are several other examples in scripture of how to
								pray. The Psalms are very good prayers. Paul's prayers in his
								epistles, especially in Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians
								are passages that can guide us in how to pray. One thing we need
								to be mindful of while praying passages of scripture is that
								simply repeating the words is pointless. We should believe that
								in our hearts and pray from our hearts, otherwise it's
								meaningless. Jesus also taught against praying in vain
								repetition and encouraged us to pray in private to God.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="verse">
								"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are:
								for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the
								corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I
								say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou
								prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy
								door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father
								which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye
								pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they
								think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not
								ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things
								ye have need of, before ye ask him." Matthew 6:5-8
							</blockquote>
							<p class="paragraph">
								And one more thing to keep in mind while praying is that we must
								pray with faith and according to the will of God.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="verse">
								"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
								pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. And
								when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:
								that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
								trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father
								which is in heaven forgive your trespasses." Mark 11:24-26

							<p class="paragraph">
								Another vital part of our Christian life is studying and
								meditating upon the scriptures. The written scriptures are
								inspired by God and is the primary way in which God speaks to
								us, and it is through the scriptures that we can discern whether
								what someone is saying is true or not. Here are some passages
								about studying the scriptures.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="verse">
								"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
								ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the
								seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord;
								and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be
								like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth
								his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and
								whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." Psalm 1:1-3
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote class="verse">
								"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
								for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
								righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
								furnished unto all good works." 2 Timothy 3:16-17
							</blockquote>
							<p class="paragraph">
								Therefore, we can see that it is very important to study and
								meditate upon the word of God.
