								This message of God reconciling us to himself through the death
								and resurrection of his Son is what we call the gospel or good
								news. In order to receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life

								to turn from our evil ways, and to believe, to put our faith and

								Therefore, I urge you to repent and believe the gospel today,

								faith, not our own works. God has given you grace by sending his
